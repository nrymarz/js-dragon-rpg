## Description
This is a simple turn-based role-playing game made using only javascript and HTML5's Canvas. 

## Usage
To play this game, start the rails app in dragon-rpg-api. Then run dragon-rpg.html with a server. I used vscode liveserver for testing. 
Then you can login with any name you want and start playing.

## Development
I used VSCode's Liveserver to run the dragon-rpg.html. Other than that, there are no external libraries neccessary to run this app.
